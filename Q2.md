# Q2. Binary Search vs Interpolation Search (decrease by factor vs variable-size)

**(a)** For a sorted array (A[0 \ldots n-1]) whose keys are uniformly distributed over ([0,1]), explain why interpolation search has expected (O(\log\log n)) probes (a high-level argument is fine).

**(b)** Construct a pathological input where interpolation search degrades to (\Theta(n)), while binary search remains (\Theta(\log n)).
