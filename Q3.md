# Q3. Fake Coin on a Balance Scale (decrease by constant factor)

## (a) 2-pile algorithm and recurrence W₂(n)

**Algorithm:**
1. Split n coins into two piles: ⌊n/2⌋ and ⌈n/2⌉
2. Weigh the two piles against each other
3. The lighter pile contains the fake coin
4. If n = 1, we found it (0 weighings needed)

**Recurrence:**
- W₂(1) = 0 (base case)
- W₂(n) = 1 + W₂(⌈n/2⌉) for n > 1

**Solution:**
- W₂(n) = ⌈log₂ n⌉

**Derivation:**
At each step, we eliminate half the coins and make 1 weighing.
After k weighings, we have n/2^k coins remaining.
When n/2^k = 1, we're done: k = log₂ n
Therefore W₂(n) = ⌈log₂ n⌉

## (b) 3-pile algorithm and recurrence W₃(n)

**Algorithm:**
1. Split n coins into three piles as equal as possible:
   - Two piles of size ⌊n/3⌋
   - One pile of size n - 2⌊n/3⌋
2. Weigh the two equal-sized piles against each other
3. If they balance: fake is in the third pile (size n - 2⌊n/3⌋)
4. If they don't balance: fake is in the lighter pile (size ⌊n/3⌋)

**Recurrence:**
- W₃(1) = 0 (base case)
- W₃(n) = 1 + W₃(⌈n/3⌉) for n > 1

**Solution:**
- W₃(n) = ⌈log₃ n⌉

**Comparison:**
- W₃(n) = ⌈log₃ n⌉ = ⌈(log₂ n)/(log₂ 3)⌉ ≈ 0.631 · ⌈log₂ n⌉
- W₃(n) is asymptotically better: uses ~37% fewer weighings than W₂(n)

## (c) Explicit weighing plan for n = 26 using 3-pile method

**n = 26:**
- Pile 1: 8 coins (indices 1-8)
- Pile 2: 8 coins (indices 9-16)
- Pile 3: 10 coins (indices 17-26)

**Weighing 1:** Compare Pile 1 vs Pile 2
- If Pile 1 lighter → fake in Pile 1 (8 coins)
- If Pile 2 lighter → fake in Pile 2 (8 coins)
- If balanced → fake in Pile 3 (10 coins)

**Case: Fake in Pile 1 (8 coins):**

**Weighing 2:** Split 8 coins into {3, 3, 2}
- Compare 3 vs 3
- If lighter on left → 3 coins remain
- If lighter on right → 3 coins remain
- If balanced → 2 coins remain

**Weighing 3a:** If 3 coins remain {1, 1, 1}
- Compare coin 1 vs coin 2
- If coin 1 lighter → found
- If coin 2 lighter → found
- If balanced → coin 3 is fake

**Weighing 3b:** If 2 coins remain
- Compare coin 1 vs coin 2
- The lighter one is fake

**Maximum weighings needed:** ⌈log₃ 26⌉ = ⌈2.966⌉ = 3
